<h2><span class="h_subtitle">TO</span><br />A. BRONSON ALCOTT,<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">UPON READING HIS OCTOGENARIAN POEMS.</span></h2>

<p>The period to which the scholar of two and
eighty years belongs, is seldom that of his
youngest readers: it is more likely to be the
epoch of his own golden youth, when his masters
were before his eyes, and his companions were
the books and the friends of his heart. Thus the
aged Landor could not bring his thoughts down
from the grand forms of Greek and Roman literature
to which they were early accustomed; he
had swerved now and then from that loyalty in
middle life, impressed and acted upon as he was
by the great political events of the Napoleonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
era,&mdash;but he returned to the epigram and the
idyl in the “white winter of his age,” and the
voices of the present and of the future appealed
to him in vain. In the old Goethe there was
something more prophetic and august; he came
nearer to his contemporaries, and prepared the
way for a recognition of his greatness by the generation
which saw the grave close over him. In
this, that strange but loyal disciple of his, the
Scotch Carlyle, rendered matchless service to his
master; yet he, too, in his unhappy old age,
could only at intervals, and by gleams of inspiration,&mdash;as
at the Edinburgh University Festival,&mdash;come
into communication with the young spirits
about him. To you, dear Friend and Master, belongs
the rare good fortune (good genius rather)
that has brought you in these late days, into closer
fellowship than of yore with the active and forthlooking
spirit of the time. In youth and middle
life you were in advance of your period, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
has only now overtaken you when it must, by the
ordinance of Nature, so soon bid you farewell, as
you go forward to new prospects, in fairer worlds
than ours.</p>

<p>It is this union of youth and age, of the past
and the present&mdash;yes, and the future also&mdash;that
I have admired in these artless poems, over which
we have spent together so many agreeable hours.
Fallen upon an age in literature when the poetic
form is everywhere found, but the discerning and
inventive spirit of Poesy seems almost lost, I
have marked with delight in these octogenarian
verses, flowing so naturally from your pen, the
very contradiction of this poetic custom of the
period. Your want of familiarity with the accustomed
movement of verse in our time, brings
into more distinct notice the genuine poetical
motions of your genius. Having been admitted
to the laboratory, and privileged to witness the
action and reaction of your thought, as it crystallized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
into song, I perceived, for the first time,
how high sentiment, by which you have from
youth been inspired, may become the habitual
movement of the mind, at an age when so many,
if they live at all in spirit, are but nursing the
selfish and distorted fancies of morose singularity.
To you the world has been a brotherhood of noble
souls,&mdash;too few, as we thought, for your companionship,&mdash;but
which you have enlarged by the
admission to one rank of those who have gone,
and of us who remain to love you and listen to
your oracles. The men and the charming women
who recognized your voice when it was that of
one crying in the wilderness&mdash;“Prepare ye the
way of our Lord,” are joined, in your commemorative
sonnets, with those who hearken to its
later accents, proclaiming the same acceptable
year of the Lord.</p>

<p>It is the privilege of poets&mdash;immemorial and
native to the clan&mdash;that they should share the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
immortality they confer. This right you may
vindicate for your own. The honors you pay,
in resounding verse, to Channing, to Emerson, to
Margaret Fuller, to Hawthorne, Thoreau, and the
rest of the company with whom you trod these
groves, and honored these altars of the Spirit unnamed,
return in their echoes to yourself. They
had their special genius, and you yours no less,
though it found not the same expression with
theirs. We please our love with the thought that,
in these sonnets and canzonets of affection, you
have celebrated yourself with them; that the swift
insight, the ennobling passion for truth and virtue,
the high resolve, the austere self-sacrifice, the
gentle submission to a will eternally right, in which
these friends, so variously gifted, found a common
tie,&mdash;all these are yours also,&mdash;and may they
be ours! The monuments and trophies of genius
are perishable, but the soul’s impression abides
forever, <i>forma mentis æterna</i>. To that imperishable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
ever-beauteous, self-renouncing, loyal, and
steadfast Spirit of the Universe which we learned
to worship in our youth, and which has never forsaken
our age and bereavement, may these offerings,
and all that we are, be consecrated now and forever!</p>

<h2>AN ESSAY<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">ON THE</span><br />
SONNET AND THE CANZONET.</h2>

<p class="f150 space-above2">THE SONNET AND THE CANZONET.</p>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>“Scorn not the sonnet,” said Wordsworth, and then gave us at least
fifty noble reasons why we should not,&mdash;for so many at least of
his innumerable sonnets are above languor and indifference, and all of
them above contempt. Milton was more self-restrained than Wordsworth,
and wrote fewer sonnets, every one of which is a treasure, either for
beauty of verse, nobility of thought, happy portraiture of persons, or
quaint and savage humor,&mdash;like that on “Tetrachordon,” and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
elongated sonnet in which he denounces the Presbyterians, and tells
them to their face, “New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large.”
Shakespeare unlocked his heart with sonnets in another key than
Milton’s,&mdash;less conformed to the model of the Italian sonnet,
but more in keeping with English verse, of which Shakespeare had the
entire range. His sonnets are but quatrains following each other
by threes, with a resounding couplet binding them together in one
sheaf, and his example has made this form of the sonnet legitimate
for all who write English verse,&mdash;no matter what the studious
or the pedantic may say. Surrey also, who first used the sonnet in
English, wrote it in this free manner of Shakespeare, as well as in
the somewhat stricter form that Sidney employed, and it is only of
late years that they have tried to shut us up to one definite and
unchanging sequence and interplay of rhyme. Mr. Alcott in these new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
sonnets, the ripe fruit of an aged tree, has used the freedom
that nature gave him, and years allow: he has written with little
uniformity in the order and number of his rhymes, but with much
regard to the spirit of the sonnet as a high form of verse. I fancy
that Dante (who may be called the father of the sonnet, though not
the first to write it) chose this graceful and courteous verse,
because it is so well suited to themes of love and friendship. When
he would express sorrow or anger, or light and jesting humor, he had
recourse to the canzonet, the <i>terza rima</i>, or what he called the
ballad,&mdash;something quite unlike what we know by that name. Mr.
Alcott has followed in the same general course; his sonnets are one
thing, his canzonets another: though the difference in feeling, which
prompts him to use one form rather than the other, cannot always be
definitely expressed. It is felt rather than seen, and seen rather
by the effect of the finished poem than by the light of any rule or
formal definition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Definiteness, in fact, must not be looked for in these poems;
nor is it the characteristic of the highest poetry in any language.
Verse may be powerful and suggestive, or even clear in the sense of
producing a distinct impression on the mind, without being definite,
and responding to all the claims of analysis. I take it that few
readers will fail to see the central thought, or the vivid portraiture
in each of these sonnets and canzonets; but fewer still will be able
to explain precisely, even to their own minds, what each suggestive
phrase and period includes and excludes in its meaning. For this fine
vagueness of utterance, the sonnet has always given poets a fair
field, and our present author has not gone beyond his due privilege
in this respect, though he has availed himself of it more frequently
than many would have done. The mottoes and citations accompanying each
sonnet may help the reader to a meaning that does not at once flash in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his eyes. But he must not expect to conquer these verses at a single
reading. The thought of years, the labor of months, has been given to
the writing of them; and the reader ought not to complain if he take
as much time to comprehend them as the author took to write them. They
are worth the pains of reading many times over, and even of learning
them by heart, for which their compendious form well fits them.</p>

<p>It may be complained that these sonnets lack variety. This
is indeed a fault into which sonneteers often fall,&mdash;our
best collection of American sonnets hitherto&mdash;those of
Jones Very&mdash;being open to this censure. It will be found,
perhaps, that the sameness of rhyme and thought is often but an
appearance,&mdash;the delicate shade of meaning being expressed, in
a vocabulary of no large extent, by a rare process of combining and
collocating words. Certain phrases recur, too, because the thought
necessarily recurs,&mdash;as when the oratory of Phillips and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Parker, as of others, is characterized by the general term,
<i>eloquence</i>. In the poverty of our language, there is no other term
to use, while the qualifying words and their connection sufficiently
distinguish between one person and another. The critical are referred
to Homer, who never fails to repeat the same word, or the same verse,
when it comes in his way to do so.</p>

<p>But to return to the sonnet itself. Landor, to whom as to Thoreau,
Milton was the greatest English poet, thought that the blind Puritan
had made good his offence against the Psalms of David, by the sonnet
on the slaughtered saints of Piedmont. “Milton,” he says, “was never
half so wicked a regicide as when he lifted up his hand and smote
King David. He has atoned for it, however, by composing a magnificent
psalm of his own, in the form of a sonnet. There are others in Milton
comparable to it, but none elsewhere.” And then the wilful critic goes
on to say, putting his words into the mouth of Porson: “In the poems
of Shakespeare, which are printed as sonnets, there is sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a singular strength and intensity of thought, with little of that
imagination which was afterward to raise him highest in the universe
of poetry. Even the interest we take in the private life of this
miraculous man, cannot keep the volume in our hands long together.
We acknowledge great power, but we experience great weariness. Were
I a poet, I would much rather have written the ‘Allegro,’ or the
‘Penseroso’ than all those.” Monstrous as this comment seems to
us, there is a certain truth in it, the sonnet in large quantities
always producing weariness; for which reason, as I suppose, Dante
interspersed his love sonnets in the “Vita Nuova” and the “Convito,”
with canzonets and ballads. His commentaries&mdash;often of a
singular eloquence&mdash;also serve as a relief to the formal verse,
as his melodious Tuscan lines do to the formality of his poetical
metaphysics. A person, says Landor, “lately tried to persuade me that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
he is never so highly poetical, as when he is deeply metaphysical. He
then quoted fourteen German poets of the first order, and expressed
his compassion for Æschylus and Homer.” Dante’s metaphysics were of a
higher cast, and so interfused with love and fair ladies, that they
only weary us with a certain perplexity as to where are the limits of
courtship and of logic. Mr. Alcott also is quaintly metaphysical in
Dante’s fashion; like the sad old Florentine, but with a more cheerful
spirit, he addresses himself</p>

theme,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“Thou art like that which is most sweet and fair,</span>
<span class="i0">A gentle morning in the youth of spring,</span>
<span class="i0">When the few early birds begin to sing</span>

<span class="i0">Yet shouldst thou these dear beauties much impair,</span>
<span class="i0">Since thou art better than is everything</span>
<span class="i0">Which or the woods or skies or green fields bring,</span>
<span class="i0">And finer thoughts hast thou than they can wear.</span>
<span class="i0">In the proud sweetness of thy grace I see</span>

<span class="i0">As the soft breathing of midsummer wind.”</span>

<p>In the changes of time and the fitful mood of the poet, sadness
succeeds to this assured joy, and he sings,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“The day has past, I never may return;</span>
<span class="i0">Twelve circling years have run since first I came</span>

<span class="i0">But once more in the pauses of thy joy,</span>
<span class="i0">Remember him who sought thee in his youth,</span>
<span class="i0">And with the old reliance of the boy</span>
<span class="i0">Asked for thy treasures in the guise of truth.”</span>
</div>

<p>Here is another voice, chanting in another strain,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“Thy beauty fades, and with it, too, my love,</span>

<span class="i0">Soft fell the rain, and, breaking from above,</span>
<span class="i0">The sun looked out upon our nuptial hour;</span>
<span class="i0">And I had thought forever by thy side</span>
<span class="i0">With bursting buds of hope in youth to dwell;</span>
<span class="i0">But one by one Time strewed thy petals wide,</span>
<span class="i0">And every hope’s wan look a grief can tell;</span>
<span class="i0">For I had thoughtless lived beneath his sway,</span>
<span class="i0">Who like a tyrant dealeth with us all,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Crowning each rose, though rooted in decay,</span>
<span class="i0">With charms that shall the spirit’s love enthral,</span>
<span class="i0">And, for a season, turn the soul’s pure eyes</span>
<span class="i0">From virtue’s bloom that time and death defies.”</span>
</div>

<p>Out of this valley of sadness the spirit rises on bolder wing, as
the melancholy mood passes away,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“Hearts of eternity, hearts of the deep!</span>

<span class="i0">And do all things rather than pause to weep.</span>
<span class="i0">A human heart knows naught of littleness,</span>
<span class="i0">Suspects no man, compares with no one’s ways,</span>
<span class="i0">Hath in one hour most glorious length of days,</span>
<span class="i0">A recompense, a joy, a loveliness;</span>
<span class="i0">Like eaglet keen, shoots into azure far,</span>
<span class="i0">And always dwelling nigh is the remotest star.”</span>
</div>

<p>Here, as Landor said, “is a sonnet, and the sonnet admits not that
approach to the prosaic which is allowable in the ballad.” For this
reason Mr. Alcott, who began his poetical autobiography, when he was
eighty years old, in a ballad measure, has now passed into the majesty
of the sonnet, as he has come to those passages of life which will not
admit prosaic treatment. Moderately used, and not worked to death, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Wordsworth employed it, the sonnet is a great uplifter of poesy.
It calls to the reader, as the early Christian litanies did to
the worshipper, <i>Sursum corda</i>, Raise your thoughts! The canzonet
lets us down again into the pathetic, the humorous, or the
fanciful,&mdash;though in this volume the canzonet generally betokens
sadness. It may easily become an ode, as in the verses on Garfield:
indeed the ode may be considered as an extended canzonet, or the
canzonet as a brief ode. It is the sonnet that chiefly concerns us
now, and that form of the sonnet which deals with love; since the germ
of this book was a romance of love, seeking to express itself in the
uplifting strain and tender cadence of successive sonnets; which lead
us though green pastures and beside the still waters, and then to the
shore of the resounding sea,&mdash;itself worthy of a sonnet which I
have somewhere heard:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“Ah mournful Sea! Yet to our eyes he wore</span>
<span class="i0">The placid look of some great god at rest;</span>
<span class="i0">With azure arms he clasped the embracing shore,</span>
<span class="i0">While gently heaved the billows of his breast;</span>
<span class="i0">We scarce his voice could hear, and then it seemed</span>
<span class="i0">The happy murmur of a lover true,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, in the sweetness of his sleep, hath dreamed</span>
<span class="i0">Of kisses falling on his lips like dew.</span>
<span class="i0">Far off, the blue and gleaming hills above,</span>
<span class="i0">The Sun looked through his veil of thinnest haze,</span>
<span class="i0">As coy Diana, blushing at her love,</span>
<span class="i0">Half hid with her own light her earnest gaze,</span>
<span class="i0">When on the shady Latmian slope she found</span>
<span class="i0">Fair-haired Endymion slumbering on the ground.”</span>
</div>

<p>This is one picture in the kaleidoscope of Aphrodite, who was a
sea-born goddess, and partial to her native element. Yet it is not
through the eye alone that she ensnares us, but with the music of
birds,&mdash;and in poetry her own darling bird is not the dove, but
the nightingale,&mdash;a stranger to our orchards and forests, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
familiar to the groves of the Muse. A poet, by no means happy in his
love in after years, thus saluted this bird, with music as sweet as
her own,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy spray,</span>
<span class="i0">Warblest at eve, when all the woods are still,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou with fresh hope the lover’s heart doth fill,</span>
<span class="i0">While the jolly Hours lead on propitious May.</span>
<span class="i0">Thy liquid notes, that close the eye of day,</span>
<span class="i0">First heard before the shallow cuckoo’s bill,</span>
<span class="i0">Portend success in love; O, if Jove’s will</span>
<span class="i0">Have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay,</span>
<span class="i0">Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate</span>
<span class="i0">Foretell my hopeless doom in some grove nigh;</span>
<span class="i0">As thou from year to year hast sung too late</span>
<span class="i0">For my relief, yet hadst no reason why;</span>
<span class="i0">Whether the Muse, or Love call thee his mate,</span>
<span class="i0">Both them I serve, and of their train am I.”</span>
</div>

<p>This is plainly a fabricated song, not poured out from the heart,
though full of melodious fancy. More natural and earnest is the tone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in which our poet soon after praises one who had passed unheeding by
the bower of love, and devoted herself to a life of piety and good
deeds. We cannot guess who she was, but such saints are seen in every
land and age.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“Lady, that in the prime of earliest youth</span>
<span class="i0">Wisely hast shunned the broad way and the green,</span>
<span class="i0">And with those few art eminently seen</span>
<span class="i0">That labor up the hill of heavenly truth,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">The better part with Mary and with Ruth,</span>
<span class="i0">Chosen thou hast; and they that overween,</span>
<span class="i0">And at thy growing virtues fret their spleen,</span>
<span class="i0">No anger find in thee, but pity and ruth.</span>
<span class="i0">Thy care is fixed, and zealously attends</span>
<span class="i0">To fill thy odorous lamp with deeds of light,</span>
<span class="i0">And hope that reaps not shame. Therefore be sure</span>
<span class="i0">Thou, when the bridegroom with his feastful friends</span>
<span class="i0">Passes to bliss at the mid hour of night,</span>
<span class="i0">Hast gained thy entrance, virginwise and pure.”</span>

<p>It is a truth for the initiated that love begins with worship,
and favors piety in its first approaches; and we need not wonder if
the devout poet in due time paid his amorous addresses to this bride
of the Spirit, whose lamp must have been dim, indeed, if it did not
reveal to her the lover in disguise of the brother in Israel. A poet
of our day, in a sonnet somewhat faulty in form, but true to the faith
of your pilgrim-vow, ye happy palmers of Love,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“O voi che per la via d’Amor passate!”</span>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">has written as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“‘As calmest waters mirror Heaven the best,</span>
<span class="i0">So best befit remembrances of thee</span>
<span class="i0">Calm holy hours from earthly passion free,</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet twilight musing,&mdash;Sabbaths in the breast.</span>
<span class="i0">No stooping thought, nor any grovelling care,</span>
<span class="i0">The sacred whiteness of that place shall stain,</span>
<span class="i0">Where, far from heartless joys and rites profane,</span>
<span class="i0">Memory has reared to thee an altar fair.</span>

<span class="i0">That waken or delight this soul of mine.’</span>
<span class="i0">So Love, meek pilgrim! his young vows did pay,</span>
<span class="i0">With glowing eyes that must his lips gainsay.”</span>
</div>

<p>A higher gospel is preached in the sonnet of another American poet,
who has written too few verses,&mdash;or rather has published too few
of the many he has composed.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“As unto blooming roses, summer dews,</span>
<span class="i0">Or morning’s amber to the tree-top choirs,</span>
<span class="i0">So to my bosom are the beams that use</span>
<span class="i0">To rain on me from eyes that Love inspires;</span>
<span class="i0">Your love,&mdash;vouchsafe it, royal-hearted Few,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And I will set no common price thereon;</span>
<span class="i0">O, I will keep, as Heaven his holy blue,</span>
<span class="i0">Or Night her diamonds, that dear treasure won.</span>
<span class="i0">But aught of inward faith must I forego,</span>
<span class="i0">Or miss one drop from Truth’s baptismal hand,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Think poorer thoughts, pray cheaper prayers, and grow</span>
<span class="i0">Less worthy trust, to meet your hearts’ demand:</span>
<span class="i0">Farewell! your wish I for your sake deny;</span>
<span class="i0">Rebel to love in truth to love am I.”</span>
</div>

<p>A poet who has been more than once quoted in this essay, saw
no sharp hostility between Love and Death,&mdash;those reputed
foes,&mdash;but thus addressed the last earthly benefactor of
mankind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“O Death! thou art the palace of our hopes,</span>
<span class="i0">The storehouse of our joys,&mdash;great labor’s end.”</span>
</div>

<p>His friend, confronting the same inevitable guest, questioned the
dark angel, in these lines, that conform to the rule of the sonnet in
spirit, if not in rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“What strange deep secret dost thou hold, O Death!</span>
<span class="i0">To hallow those thou claimest for thine own?</span>
<span class="i0">That which the open book could never teach,</span>
<span class="i0">The closed one whispers, as we stand alone</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By one, how more alone than we!&mdash;and strive</span>
<span class="i0">To comprehend the passion of that peace.</span>
<span class="i0">In vain our thoughts would wind within the heart,</span>
<span class="i0">The heart of this great mystery of release!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Baptism of Death&mdash;which steepest infant eyes</span>
<span class="i0">In grace of calm that saints might hope to wear,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose cold touch purifies the guilty brow,</span>
<span class="i0">And sets again the seal of childhood there&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Our line of life in vain would sound thy sea,</span>
<span class="i0">That which we seek to know,&mdash;we soon shall be.”</span>
</div>

<p>Let me now close this garland of sonnets with two choice flowers
from that garden of Elizabeth which no modern botanist and no
anthologist of ancient fame can equal in fragrance and amaranthine
beauty. Both breathe the sweetness of Love,&mdash;the first, from the
“Parthenophe and Parthenophil” of Barnaby Barnes, with some flavor
of discontent,&mdash;but the second, taken from the warm hand of
Shakespeare, is full of that noble confidence, which he, of all poets,
most naturally inspires.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“Ah, sweet Content! where is thy mild abode?</span>
<span class="i0">Is it with shepherds and light-hearted swains,</span>
<span class="i0">Which sing upon the downs and pipe abroad,</span>
<span class="i0">Tending their flocks and cattle on the plains?</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, sweet Content! where dost thou safely rest?</span>
<span class="i0">In heaven? with angels which the praises sing</span>
<span class="i0">Of Him that made and rules at his behest</span>
<span class="i0">The minds and hearts of every living thing?</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, sweet Content! where does thy harbor hold?</span>
<span class="i0">Is it in churches with religious men,</span>
<span class="i0">Which please the gods with prayers manifold,</span>
<span class="i0">And in their studies meditate it then?</span>
<span class="i0">Whether thou dost on heaven or earth appear,</span>
<span class="i0">Be where thou wilt, thou wilt not harbor here.”</span>
</div>

<p>And now upon this delicious disconsolate strophe, hear the brave
turn and reply of Shakespeare’s antistrophe,&mdash;and take it for
your consolation, lovers and poets!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">“Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul</span>
